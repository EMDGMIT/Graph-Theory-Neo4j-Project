// This query calculates the Average number of people represented by each Dáil seat. We call the Constituency 
// node, then we use the function avg() to sum all the instances of properties population and seats and 
// return the overall average. We then divide the 2 results by each other the get the average number of 
// people per Dáil seat. This number is slightly below what the actual average should be because the 
// population number for each Constituency only represents those eligible to vote.
